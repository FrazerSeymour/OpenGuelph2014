  This repo contains my work for the Open Guelph hackathon, taking place over 24 hours from the morning of February 22nd until that of the 23rd.

  I plan to use the Flask framework to create a web application that will give directions to local parks and attractions. Here's to a productive weekend!

  And we're off! 

  Fairly slow start. Created a 'scripts' directory to hold the Python scripts I'm using to parse data. At present it holds one script: 'parseRoutes', which parses the 'stop_times.txt' file, converting the data into 'Route' classes and storing it in a pickled file.
